So here we are in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, living an altered version of the lives we knew. In the spirit of exploration and boredom, I've decided to start a mostly-technical blog of things I'm working on or discover that seem interesting to me. I have no specific agenda; we'll just see how it goes.

I'm using the git-based CMS Foresty, along with Gridsome and Vue.js to get it off the ground quickly. So far I have no complaints. I'm sure I'll continue to tweak the layout and styles for a while.

_Edit: Well, actually, I do have some complaints about getting dynamic image sources from Forestry to work in Gridsome. There are some lengthy_ [_github_ _issues_](https://www.ericbroucek.us/blog/hello-pandemic-life) _on the topic without a clear solution (at least one that worked for me). I then decided to try out Forestry's integration with Cloudinary, another service I've been wanting to check out more. Long story short- that's not working yet either. This will probably end up a lengthier post one day soon..._
