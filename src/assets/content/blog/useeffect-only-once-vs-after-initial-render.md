Well, on the one hand I didn't do the greatest job posting over the last 6 months, but on the other hand I did jot down a number of ideas that I'll try to catch up on in the near future.  

First one is a quickie.  I've been on a project for the last 4-5 months using React, and this is the first time I've been able to use hooks on a regular basis.  They took some getting used to but for most common uses it's a huge improvement.
