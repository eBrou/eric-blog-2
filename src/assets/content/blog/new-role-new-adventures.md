I've recently started a new role as Front End Engineer at [Continued](www.continued.com "continued"), a company who provides online continuing education courses for various professions.  It's an exciting career step for me and I'm thrilled to be joining a company with a positive mission and great culture.  Also, did I mention it's fully remote... forever?!  Yes!!

For the last several years I've worked at the Los Angeles- based design and development agency, [Bean](www.bean.la "bean").  It was my first role in development after pivoting from a career in music, and I'll forever be grateful for that opportunity.  Now, however, rather than building anything and everything for external clients - often with tight turnarounds - I'll be on a dedicated product team for the long haul, crafting their next generation core application.  It will be a different environment, to be sure, but one I'm excited to dive into.  There are going to be lots of new and interesting challenges to look forward in my new position, and hopefully I'll be able to add more updates to the blog as I go.
